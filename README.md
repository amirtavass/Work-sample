<h1>violet Website</h1>
This SinglePage website is a RESPONSIVE workSample (that I wrote with ONLY js WITHOUT any framework) which has Watches as products for men and women.with details for products and cool design.
<h2>Responsive Header</h2>
<li>We have the logo and the searchBox in the header of the website and it will activate when you click on the Icon.</li>
<li>Responsive Header.</li>
<li>the hambergerMenu and aside will show up when you minimize the width.</li>
 <h2>main</h2>
<li>two main photos for background with blur and grayScale</li>
<li>3 pictures of watches for each gender on the side of the photos.</li>
<li>two Buttons at the middle of the screen that when activated,it will show the products of that gender</li>
<h2>Responsive products</h2>
<li>products and pageNumber are added in js and by innerHTML,I'm creating them.</li>
<h2>Responsive modals</h2>
<li>modals are the detail version of the products which will be showed on the products.</li>
<li>modals are also made in JS in a function.</li>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
At first I wanted to put the information in an array and use JSON to access the information.</br></br>
But then a back-end part(php) for my products was added in the update so that I would learn the bridge between front-end and back-end in JS.(the backend was not writen by me).
so all the information are read by the backend.
